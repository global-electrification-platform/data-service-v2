In the low demand scenario, the urban demand target is informed by the average consumption observed in currently electrified areas in the country, translated into the nearest access Tier (e.g. U4 – Urban Tier 4). Low rural demand target is always set to Tier 1 (e.g. R1 – Rural Tier 1). The high demand target scenario reflects more aggressive goals. Urban demand target is increased by 1 Tier, unless already Tier 5, while rural demand target is increased by 2 Tiers. The bottom-up scenario assigns a unique demand target (kWh/cap/year) in each settlement, based on local poverty rate and GDP level.\\",\\"options\\":[{\\"id\\":0,\\"value\\":\\"Top-down demand target - Low (U4R1)\\"},{\\"id\\":1,\\"value\\":\\"Top-down demand target - High (U5R3)\\"},{\\"id\\":2,\\"value\\":\\"Bottom-up demand target (Poverty-GDP)\\"}]}","{\\"id\\":2,\\"label\\":\\"Intermediate investment plan\\",\\"description\\":\\"Definition: Indicates the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025).

This cost is one of the factors that affect the LCoE of connecting to the grid (together with extension of the grid lines etc.), and can affect the split between grid- and off-grid technologies. Estimated on-grid cost scenario assumes an optimal generating cost of electricity by the central grid based on the Electricity Model Base for Africa (TEMBA).  High on-grid cost scenario assumes a generating cost of electricity by the central grid increased by 25% so as to account for deviations from the optimal plan (construction delays, deployment of emergency fossil fuel based units etc.), which can increase generating cost affecting thus the split between grid- and off-grid technologies.\\",\\"options\\":[{\\"id\\":0,\\"value\\":\\"Estimated on-grid cost (0.013 $/kWh)\\"},{\\"id\\":1,\\"value\\":\\"High on-grid cost (0.016 $/kWh)\\"}]}","{\\"id\\":4,\\"label\\":\\"PV system cost\\",\\"description\\":\\"Definition: Examines the role of PV system costs on electrification results.

Note! a generation capacity limit for the centralized grid is applied in order to keep grid expansion to sensible levels.
